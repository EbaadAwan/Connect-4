# Connect-4
This version of Connect 4 gives you the option of playing against a player or CPU. This is a game I created for my culminating project in Grade 11 for Intro to Computer Science. I used my knowledge of Java and implemented If Loops, While Loops, For Loops, Arrays, 2D Arrays, Strings and Methods.
